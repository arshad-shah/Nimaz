Write Google Play Store release notes for an Islamic app called Nimaz.

STRICT RULES:
- Max 500 characters total
- Write ONLY what end users care about (new features, fixes they notice, UX improvements)
- NEVER mention: CI/CD, deployment, workflows, metadata, store listings, pipelines, database versions, migrations, code refactoring, internal tooling, release processes
- If all commits are internal/technical with nothing user-facing, write ONLY: "Bug fixes and performance improvements."
- No greetings, no sign-offs, no "thank you", no "enjoy"
- No bold, no headers, no markdown formatting
- Plain text with simple bullet points using - prefix
- Keep it short and natural, like how top apps write changelogs

Commits to analyze (ignore any that are purely internal):
