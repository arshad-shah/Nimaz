Design this component using the "Nimaz Design Language":

Core characteristics to maintain:
- Material 3 surfaces with elevated cards (24.dp corners)
- Layered information hierarchy using nested surfaces
- Interactive elements with spring animations (DampingRatioMediumBouncy)
- Container-based design with proper elevation hierarchy
- Rich color system using Material 3 tokens (primary, secondary, tertiary containers)

Visual elements to include:
- Icon containers with colorful surface backgrounds
- Pill-shaped secondary surfaces for metadata
- Smooth state transitions and color animations
- Shimmer loading states
- Information density with proper spacing (16-20dp padding)

Interaction patterns:
- Scale animations on active/highlighted states
- Content size animations using springs
- Fade and slide transitions for content changes
- Elevated states for active elements
- Rich hover and press states
